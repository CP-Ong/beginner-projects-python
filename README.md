# Beginner Python Projects

This repository is a collection of projects in Python. These projects are guided through the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?couponCode=ST14MT101024) on Udemy. The primary goal of this repository is to track my learning progress and demonstrate my motivation and commitment.

## Purpose
I am currently building a strong foundation in Python through daily coding challenges. This repository serves to:
- Track my learning journey and progress in Python programming.
- Apply Python concepts in real-world projects.
- Build a portfolio to showcase to employers and the developer community.
