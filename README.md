# Beginner Python Projects

This repository is a collection of projects in Python. These projects are guided through the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?couponCode=ST14MT101024) on Udemy. The primary goal of this repository is to track my learning progress and demonstrate my motivation and commitment.

## Purpose
I am currently building a strong foundation in Python through daily coding challenges. This repository serves to:
- Track my learning journey and progress in Python programming.
- Apply Python concepts in real-world projects.
- Build a portfolio to showcase to employers and the developer community.


## Projects
### [Project 1: Blackjack Card Game](Project1_Blackjack-Game)
  > Created a game of Blackjack.
### [Project 2: Turtle Crossing Game](Project2_Turtle-Crossing-Game)
  > Created a turtle crossing game using OOP.
### [Project 3: Flash Card App](Project3_Flash-Card-App)
  > Created a simple flash card app using tkinter and pandas.

## Projects Overview
The repository includes projects across various Python topics, such as:
- Basic syntax and operations
- Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries)
- Functions and modules
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File handling
- Error handling
- Working with APIs
- Automation with Python
- Games and graphical user interfaces (GUI)
<!-- - Web development with Flask -->
Each project folder contains Python scripts with detailed explanations and comments.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **PyCharm**: Integrated development environment 
- **Tkinter**: GUI development
- **Requests**: API handling
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation (for data-related projects)
- **Other Libraries**: Based on project requirements
<!-- - **Flask**: Web framework -->
## Course Details
This repository follows the **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** on Udemy, where I commit to writing Python code daily. The course provides a mix of theoretical knowledge and hands-on projects to solidify concepts. I started the course on 23/09/2024. I stopped the course on 12/10/2024 after completing Day 40 to focus on other data science skills.

## How to Use
Each folder contains:
1. Python scripts for each project.
2. Explanations and comments within the code for clarity.
3. Additional resources such as data files or external libraries where applicable.
